Welcome to my web-page. My name is Yury(transliterated as yurij, iurii, etc.).
Iâ€™m a mathematician. I enjoy mathematical analysis that has a geometric flavour. 
I am particularly interested in real analysis, geometric measure theory, analysis on metric spaces, metric geometry, snakeness; 
I am interested in free software, SQL, data base theory.

This page looks primitive. Forget about slick layout, just make the pages informative. 
Layout and graphical cosmetics are of secondary importance. 
All pages have a single column layout with width the can be regulated by width of browser window. 
The page is generated from org-mode file, which is easy to maintain. 
Org-mode is a reliable (readable, plain text) format.   

Notes of general interest (on Information Technology, mostly) can be found here.
